Simulator conducts inference on a CNNX model, which contains an ONNX model file and a quantization information encodings file. It can check output and intermediate tensors during execution.
Quantized inference is performed using _simulated quantization_. Simulated quantization provides the capability to mimic the effects of quantized operations. Floating point values are clipped and divided into several ranges, and values within each range are converted to the same value, simulating the quantization process.
Simulator includes the following features(with example codes):","The purpose of applying Fixed Precision Quantization to the optimized CNNX model is to reduce the model size and computational requirements, allowing it to run efficiently on hardware with limited resources. This process involves converting the model's parameters from high precision (such as floating-point) to a lower precision (such as 8-bit integers), which can lead to faster inference times and reduced power consumption. Additionally, Fixed Precision Quantization can help in keeping the model's performance (accuracy) comparable to its original form by optimizing the precision level for different parts of the model.","The purpose of applying Fixed Precision Quantization to the optimized CNNX model is to perform quantization, which typically involves reducing the precision of the model's weights and activations to improve efficiency, such as reducing model size and increasing inference speed.",0,0.00498,0.54013,

## **Dataset format**
The dataset format must use the .h5 file extension. It is important to ensure that the keys in the h5 dataset match the input names of the model for proper mapping to occur.
Additionally, as the Exynos AI Studio currently only accepts float32 data types, the internal data within the h5 file must be in fp32 format.
The h5 file should be placed directly under the DATA folder, which is generated after executing the 'enntools init' command in the workspace.

## **Detailed instruction for dataset preparation**
Analyze model inputs using Netron. The example model receives three inputs: encoder_hidden_states, sample, and timestep.

Create a JSON file named 'input_folder_mapping.json'. In this file, define key-value pairs where each key represents a model input name and its corresponding value is the name of the folder containing the input data for that model input.
```json
{
	""encoder_hidden_states"": ""input_encoder_hidden_states"",
	""sample"": ""sample"",
	""timestep"": ""timestep""
}
```
After preparing the dataset and JSON file, create a dataset directory and place it in the specified location.

It's important to note that the file names for each input should be identical, as shown in the example above.

				""scale"": 0.0
			}","To compare two CNNX models using their inference outputs and intermediate tensors, you can use the simulator tool provided by the ENN SDK. Here’s how you can do it based on the provided context:

1. **Compare Inference Outputs**:
   - Use the `compare_model_by_inference` function from the simulator to compare the outputs of the two models. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is used as the metric for comparison.

2. **Compare Intermediate Tensors**:
   - Use the `compare_model_by_layer` function to compare the intermediate tensors for each layer of the two CNNX models. This involves comparing the feature maps at various layers to ensure that the models perform similarly on intermediate levels as well.

For example, here’s a Python snippet using `compare_model_by_layer` to compare intermediate tensors for each layer:

```python
from simulator import api

params = api.LayerwiseCheckerParameters(
    input_data_path=""/path/to/input/data"",
    input_model_path_0=""/path/to/model/0.onnx"",
    input_encodings_path_0=""/path/to/model/0.encodings"",
    input_model_path_1=""/path/to/model/1.onnx"",
    input_encodings_path_1=""/path/to/model/1.encodings"",
    metric=""snr"",
    threshold=100,
    use_cuda=False,
    layer_match_info=[(""featuremap_0"", ""featuremap_0""), (""featuremap_1"", ""featuremap_1"")],
    export_featuremap=True,
    export_featuremap_path=""/path/to/save/exported/featuremap""
)

res = api.compare_model_by_layer(params)
print(""Layerwise check:"")
for input_name, result in res.items():
    _, result_dict = result
    for output_name, snr_value in result_dict.items():
        print(f""{output_name}: {snr_value}"")
```

In this example, the `layer_match_info` is used to specify which feature maps should be compared between the two models. Adjust the paths and parameters according to your specific models and data.","Two CNNX models can be compared using their inference outputs by using the `compare_model_by_inference` feature, which uses the SNR value as the comparison metric. They can also be compared using their intermediate tensors for each layer by using the `compare_model_by_layer` feature.",0.69643,0.00463,0.61303,

2. **Configure the YAML File**:
   - In the `quantizer` section of your YAML configuration file, you need to specify the following:
     - **precision_weight**: Define the general precision for weights (e.g., int8, int16, fp16).
     - **precision_activation**: Define the general precision for activations (e.g., int8, int16, fp16).
     - **mpq_operator_dict**: Specify a dictionary where you input the operators and precisions to be quantized differently from the specified general precisions for weights and activations.

Content:
#### Data Processing Procedures
- **Pre-processing** and **Post-processing**: Implement these tasks outside the main model computation.
	For efficient execution, it is recommended to use parallel processing on GPU or CPU.
- **Memory Alignment**: Includes data transformation operations such as `split` and `reshape` during the pre-processing phase to ensure proper data alignment.
#### Layer Adjustments
To enhance performance, it is recommended to exclude the dropout layer.
#### PReLU
Use the `PReLU` activation function for optimal performance.
Although `LeakyReLU` is functional, it may not provide the same level of efficiency.
#### Sharing IFM and OFM Recursively
Merge successive concatenate layers that share the same Input Feature Maps (IFM) and Output Feature Maps (OFM).; Section: # Optimizer

1. **Mixed Precision by Name**: This method allows users to specify different precisions for particular activation or weight names in a model.

2. **Mixed Precision by Operator**: Users define different precisions for various types of operators. For example, you can set all outputs of the Add operator to INT4, thereby quantizing them to this precision.

These approaches enable different parts of the model to use different precisions, potentially optimizing performance and efficiency.","Different precisions can be utilized in a model using mixed precision approaches by specifying precisions for specific activation or weight names, or by defining precisions for different types of operators, such as setting the Add operator to INT4, which quantizes all outputs of the Add operators to INT4.",0.8,0.04237,0.65953,

Optimization Template Component
- Optimize Name: Name of the optimization you want to apply
- Trigger condition : Trigger condition for starting application of the Optimization technique in graph search (typically, the trigger condition is the operator type)
- Origin Module: Module before optimization
- Origin condition: Check that the Origin Module is candidate to this optimization technique (applied if trigger condition is triggered)
- Optimized Module: Module after optmization
- Optimization: Modification condition of Optimized applied model (optional)
### Flow
The Optimizer Templates are executed as shown in the flow chart below. In searching for the model, the node meets the trigger_op method of the template for the first time. Then it loops through the origin_condition of the case. If the condition is correct, it optimizes the module through steps.; Section: # Optimizer

To convert a model:
1. Prepare a pre-trained NN model.
2. Set parameters for tools.
3. Execute tools for conversion.
#### Model Execution
Executing converted models is performed by the ENN framework.
When using the ENN framework:
1. Initialize ENN framework.
2. Load the converted model to ENN framework.
3. Allocate and commit all the necessary buffers for the model.
Then:
1. Copy input data to input buffers.
2. Execute model on ENN framework.
3. Use data on output buffers.
	> To execute the model multiple times, repeat this process.
Finally, perform the following steps:
1. Uncommit and release buffers allocated to the model.
2. Unload the model.
3. De initialize ENN framework.
ENN framework APIs support language binding for C++.
### Supported Neural Network Models

For more information on supported TensorFlow Lite operations, refer to the Support Matrix.; Content:
# **Dataset preparation**
This is a guideline for preparing the input dataset.
## **Dataset format**
The dataset format must use the .h5 file extension. It is important to ensure that the keys in the h5 dataset match the input names of the model for proper mapping to occur.
Additionally, as the Exynos AI Studio currently only accepts float32 data types, the internal data within the h5 file must be in fp32 format.
The h5 file should be placed directly under the DATA folder, which is generated after executing the 'enntools init' command in the workspace.

Content:
Models are trained and generated on floating-point hardware like CPUs and GPUs. These devices generally perform well, but not for chips due to hardware constraints. Optimizer provides optimization methods for these models to perform best on Exynos chips. Optimizer supports three powerful features.
- shape_inference<br>
	If the input shape is not specified or need to be changed, shape_inference allows the user to define/modify it.
- 4dim conversion<br>
	To deploy a model with a .nnc extension on a device, all operators must have input and output shapes with four dimensions. To facilitate this, the 4D conversion process identifies and converts all channel axes of the operators to 4D while maintaining their original structure and channel axes. ; Question: Please tell us about the advantages of ENN SDK compared to other SDKs?

The `postProcess` function processes the output from the neural network model.
It converts the quantized output values to percentile scores, matches the index with the label, filters items that exceed the score threshold, and sorts them in descending order.
The filtered items provide the final classification results.

	val output = when (OUTPUT_DATA_TYPE) {
		DataType.UINT8 -> {
			modelOutput.asUByteArray().mapIndexed { index, value ->
				labelList[index] to dequantizedValues[((value.toInt()

## **Detailed instruction for dataset preparation**
Analyze model inputs using Netron. The example model receives three inputs: encoder_hidden_states, sample, and timestep.

Create a JSON file named 'input_folder_mapping.json'. In this file, define key-value pairs where each key represents a model input name and its corresponding value is the name of the folder containing the input data for that model input.
```json
{
	""encoder_hidden_states"": ""input_encoder_hidden_states"",
	""sample"": ""sample"",
	""timestep"": ""timestep""
}
```
After preparing the dataset and JSON file, create a dataset directory and place it in the specified location.

It's important to note that the file names for each input should be identical, as shown in the example above.

```","The conversion from CNNX to SNC aids in optimizing and quantizing models for better performance by facilitating a streamlined flow that incorporates several key enhancements through the conversion process:

1. **Simplified Model Representation**: The SNC format represents a more streamlined and efficient version of the model, making it easier to execute on target hardware like Exynos platforms. This simplified representation results in faster inference times and reduced computational overhead.

2. **Optimized Execution**: Before converting to SNC, models go through an optimization phase where various techniques such as Simplifier and Optimization templates are applied. This ensures that redundant operations are minimized, and the overall computational graph is well-organized for efficient execution.

3. **Effective Quantization**: During the conversion flow, quantization techniques such as Fixed Precision, Smooth Quantization, and Mixed Precision Quantization are applied. These techniques reduce the bit-width of model weights and activations, decreasing memory usage and increasing execution speed while maintaining model accuracy.

4. **Evaluation and Validation**: The conversion process includes performance evaluation stages to ensure that the quality of inference remains consistent across optimizations and quantizations. This helps validate that the converted SNC model still meets the original model's performance requirements.

Overall, the conversion from CNNX to SNC, combined with these optimization and quantization techniques, ensures that the model is not only efficient to execute but also tailored to leverage the hardware accelerations provided by Exynos platforms, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model in deployment scenarios.",The answer to given question is not present in context,0.29766,0.00571,0.17216,

Content:
Simulator conducts inference on a CNNX model, which contains an ONNX model file and a quantization information encodings file. It can check output and intermediate tensors during execution.
Quantized inference is performed using _simulated quantization_. Simulated quantization provides the capability to mimic the effects of quantized operations. Floating point values are clipped and divided into several ranges, and values within each range are converted to the same value, simulating the quantization process.
Simulator includes the following features(with example codes):","The Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) API in EHT's quantizer aids precision tweaks in a quantized CNNX model by allowing users to specify different levels of precision for various parts of the model. This API provides the flexibility to assign different precisions to specific activations and weights. 

For instance, you can choose to quantize certain activation functions or weights at a higher precision while keeping other parts at a lower precision. This can be done for either specific activation or weight names or by defining precisions for different types of operators. This approach enables users to optimize the model by balancing the trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy.

Additionally, the MPQ debug API allows users to experiment by selecting different activation and weight precisions, enabling users to fine-tune their models effectively. 

Overall, the MPQ API provides a powerful tool for managing precision in a quantized CNNX model, allowing for detailed customization and optimization of a model's performance.",The MPQ API aids precision tweaks in a quantized CNNX model by allowing users to select different activations and weights and assign them varying levels of precision.,0.9,0.00694,0.45088,
