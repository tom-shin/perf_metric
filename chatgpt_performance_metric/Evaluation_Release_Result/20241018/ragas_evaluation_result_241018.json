The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is used as the metric for comparison.\n\n2. **Compare Intermediate Tensors**:\n   - Use the `compare_model_by_layer` function to compare the intermediate tensors for each layer of the two CNNX models. This involves comparing the feature maps at various layers to ensure that the models perform similarly on intermediate levels as well.\n\nFor example, here’s a Python snippet using `compare_model_by_layer` to compare intermediate tensors for each layer:\n\n```python\nfrom simulator import api\n\nparams = api.LayerwiseCheckerParameters(\n    input_data_path=\"/path/to/input/data\",\n    input_model_path_0=\"/path/to/model/0.onnx\",\n    input_encodings_path_0=\"/path/to/model/0.encodings\",\n    input_model_path_1=\"/path/to/model/1.onnx\",\n    input_encodings_path_1=\"/path/to/model/1.encodings\",\n    metric=\"snr\",\n    threshold=100,\n    use_cuda=False,\n    layer_match_info=[(\"featuremap_0\", \"featuremap_0\"), (\"featuremap_1\", \"featuremap_1\")],\n    export_featuremap=True,\n    export_featuremap_path=\"/path/to/save/exported/featuremap\"\n)\n\nres = api.compare_model_by_layer(params)\nprint(\"Layerwise check:\")\nfor input_name, result in res.items():\n    _, result_dict = result\n    for output_name, snr_value in result_dict.items():\n        print(f\"{output_name}: {snr_value}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `layer_match_info` is used to specify which feature maps should be compared between the two models.

The user converts NN models to NNC models.\n\tNNC is an NN model format that can run efficiently in Samsung Exynos hardware.\n2. The user executes the converted model for inference.\n#### Model Conversion\nUse one of the tools that is provided to convert NN models.\nTo convert a model:\n1. Prepare a pre-trained NN model.\n2. Set parameters for tools.\n3. Execute tools for conversion.\n#### Model Execution\nExecuting converted models is performed by the ENN framework.\nWhen using the ENN framework:\n1. Initialize ENN framework.\n2. Load the converted model to ENN framework.\n3. Allocate and commit all the necessary buffers for the model.\nThen:\n1. Copy input data to input buffers.\n2. Execute model on ENN framework.\n3. Use data on output buffers.\n\t> To execute the model multiple times, repeat this process.\nFinally, perform the following steps:\n1. Uncommit and release buffers allocated to the model.\n2. Unload the model.\n3.

This simplified representation results in faster inference times and reduced computational overhead.\n\n2. **Optimized Execution**: Before converting to SNC, models go through an optimization phase where various techniques such as Simplifier and Optimization templates are applied. This ensures that redundant operations are minimized, and the overall computational graph is well-organized for efficient execution.\n\n3. **Effective Quantization**: During the conversion flow, quantization techniques such as Fixed Precision, Smooth Quantization, and Mixed Precision Quantization are applied. These techniques reduce the bit-width of model weights and activations, decreasing memory usage and increasing execution speed while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n4. **Evaluation and Validation**: The conversion process includes performance evaluation stages to ensure that the quality of inference remains consistent across optimizations and quantizations. This helps validate that the converted SNC model still meets the original model's performance requirements.\n\nOverall, the conversion from CNNX to SNC, combined with these optimization and quantization techniques, ensures that the model is not only efficient to execute but also tailored to leverage the hardware accelerations provided by Exynos platforms, thereby enhancing the overall performance of the model in deployment scenarios.",

        "answer": "Users can use the EHT module for Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) by specifying the activation names or operators in the quantizer configuration. The quantizer module within the EHT offers this capability by allowing users to define different precision levels for different parts of the model.\n\nHere is how it can be done:\n\n1. **Mixed Precision by Activation Name:** Users can specify the precision for specific activation names within the model. This allows various parts of the model to use different precisions based on the specified names.\n\n2. **Mixed Precision by Operator:** Users can define precisions for different types of operators. For instance, if the user sets the \"Add\" operator to INT4, all outputs of the \"Add\" operators are quantized to INT4.\n\nThese configurations are done via the EHT YAML file, where users define which activations or operators should have specific precisions different from the rest of the model. The key parameters within the YAML file related to the quantizer are:\n- **mpq_operator_dict:** A dictionary to specify the operators and precision to be quantized differently.\n- **precision_weight:** To set the precision for weights (e.g., int8, int16, fp16).\n- **precision_activation:** To set the precision for activations (e.g., int8, int16, fp16).\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient quantization process, adapting the precision needs based on the model's specific parts, leading to potentially better performance and resource optimization.",
